     I. QUICK START
     ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

     If you are impatient and don't want to read all the documentation before 
     trying this program, type:

                mp        
     or         mp -a-i   If your machine is 10Mhz - 12Mhz


     II. EXTRA INFORMATION
     ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

     1          If your video card supports text modes such as 25*132,
                44*132, 60*132 or just about any other text mode then enter
                this mode (using the utility supplied with your card) and
                MODPLAY PRO will take full advantage of it when selecting 
                filenames

     2          Modplay Pro now has full PROTRACKER support.  See a later 
                section for details.  MODPLAY can execute your programs
                while playing mods - see section 3.1

     3          The Modplay config file must exist in one of two places
		i)  The current directory
		ii) The directory in which the copy of MP.COM you are running
		    is in.
  
     4          Modplay Pro will now view .GIF files including GIFs that have
                been GIFLITE'd and GIF89's.  The last .GIF file viewed will be
                used as the background to the VGA scope display (F10 when
                playing).  No support for Interlaced GIF's.
  

     III.  INTRODUCTION TO MODPLAY PRO
     ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

     Modplay Pro allows you to play Amiga soundtracker/noisetracker files,
     Protracker files and even 4 channel Startrekker files on a PC 
     (10Mhz or faster clock speed, 286 processor or better).  
     Modplay Pro is written *entirely* in assembler and now runs to over
     11,000 lines of source and has taken around 400 hours to produce.

     *** DOES NOT ALWAYS WORK WHEN USING emm386 ON A 386 PC ***	


     1.   WHAT ARE MODULES?
     ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

     A module consists of 15 (or 31) sampled instruments and a four channel
     music track.  By playing the instruments at different pitches a
     soundtrack lasting many minutes can be produced.  The PC speaker is not
     really up to handling modules, since in total we have a 10 bit sample
     to be played, and the speaker can only handle 5 (and thats only just
     possible).  A D/A converter gives 8 and the stereo version gives 
     effectively 9. The output sounds OK through a good sized PC speaker, the 
     cheap piezo devices found in some computers including laptops are not 
     really designed to cope.  So through external hardware MODPLAY PRO comes 
     close to the quality you would get on an AMIGA.


     2. IMPLEMENTATION
     ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

     MODPLAY PRO implements all Amiga effects such as vibrato etc.
     Most Amiga modules have samples in them that are less than 64k each in
     length, these can be played as normal on any 286 10Mhz or better;  a
     rare few have samples >64k in them and although these will be played
     by modplay pro you really need a 16MHz machine minimum to keep up.  These 
     modules are marked with a '*' on the top line of the display next to the
     filename when they are playing.

     2A. PROTRACKER
     ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

     On the Amiga there are a wide variety of tracker players.  By far
     the best (personal opinion) is the Protracker player.  Protracker
     modules can have many more commands in them (Thinks like Tremelo,
     Note delays,  Repeat loops,  etc)  and I have recently found many
     modules are Protracker ones and so benefit greatly by implementing
     this new set of commands.  All Protracker commands execept FunkInvert
     (EFx) are implemented (FunkInvert just plays a sample sort of
     backwards... this would mean changing my interrupt routines a little
     too much and would slow down normal songs)


     3. MODPLAY PRO OPTIONS - COMMAND LINE PLAYING
     ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

     From the command line a module can be played through any of the output
     devices with or without a moving graph display.  The format is 

     MP [-q] [-0..6] [-a/-b] [-output device] [filename [.MOD]
 
     Items in [ ] are optional.   The -q if present tells MODPLAY PRO not to
     display any text and so the module will play without disturbing the
     text display.  (You could use this in a game's title screen written
     in C or Basic, by doing a system or shell command - MODPLAY PRO exits when
     a key is pressed).  The -(number) tells MODPLAY PRO what hardware to play
     the module through.  The filename can contain wildcard characters
     (*,?), so MP * would be valid and would play all the *.MOD files
     in the current directory one after the other.  Playback of a sequence
     of files can be aborted by pressing ESCape two or three times in rapid
     sucession.  

     -0  is the PC Speaker (default unless a stereo-on-one card is found)
     -l1 is a D/A converter on printer port 1
     -l2 is a D/A converter on printer port 2
     -l3 is a D/A converter on printer port 3
     -l4 is a D/A converter on printer port 4
     -ls is 2 D/A converters, one on port1 the other on port2 (gives stereo)
     -lm is 2 D/A converters as above but giving mono.

     -xm
       This is of use if you have a single D/A converter on an expansion
       port or any known address.  Use -xm(address) where the address is
       a 3 digit hex number.  (Example -xm3B7 would play in mono to a
       D/A converter at address 03B7) 
    
     -xs
       This is similar to -xm, allowing two D/A converters and hence stereo
       operation.  Use -xs(address1)(address2).  [Example, -xs300301 would
       play in stereo to D/A converters at 0300 and 0301.  Note that these
       switchs must be used from the command line and cannot be changed when
       inside MODPLAY PRO

     -xq 
       Similar to -xs, allowing four D/A converters - this gives the Best
       possible quality!  But it may not work too well on slower computers.
       Use -xq(address1)(address2)(address3)(address4) [ Example
       -xq3003BC2F93DC would play to D/As at 0300, 03BC, 02F9 and 03DC.]
       As with -xs, all the addresses must be different!

     -y1 (-y2,...-y4)
       Disney Sound Source D/A.  This output routine is designed to drive
       the Disney D/A converter (that is supplied with some games etc.).  The
       Disney D/A sits on a parallel port but must be clocked after each
       sample (unlike the standard D/A in hardware.doc) and turned on and off.
       -y1 would output to a Disney D/A on LPT1, -y2 on LPT2 etc.   A normal
       D/A converter on a parallel port will work with this option as well,
       although it is not recommended as it is more processor intensive.

     Stereo-on-1
       Modplay Pro will autodetect a Stereo-on-1 board on any Parallel port and
       use it.  See HARDWARE.DOC for more information

     Soundblaster
       Modplay Pro will autodetect a Soundblaster card at any base address and
       use it. 

     (Using a /number will ignore anything autodetected).

     -a should be used if your computer crashes when playing tunes, it
        decreases the rate of playing samples - decreasing the quality
        noticably through the speaker, but should mean 10Mhz-12Mhz machines
        can cope.
     -b This is the default mixing speed designed for a 12MHz PC

     -d This option is used when if you don't like my choice of character 
        for drawing the bars.  I've had lots of mail all saying you would
        like different characters - so now you can choose your own,
        Usage is -dxx where xx is a two-digit hexidecimal number of the 
        character you want to use,

        -dF0    Would be ≡, the old MODPLAY default bar
        -df7    Would be ≈, one of my favorites
        -d02    is quite fun for 'acid house' type mods. 

        And if you are still not satisfied, then pressing F1 or F2 when
        playing changes the character as well!  F3 and F4 even change the
        colour of the moving bar.  Hours of fun (yawn)!

        -z      Using the -z switch somewhere on the command line will
                make modplay not check inside archive files - this will
                speed things up a bit if you have lots of non-mod archives
		in your directories

     Playing is stopped by pressing *any* key, or when the module is finished
     Modules that loop at the end, or jump backwards are stopped so they
     will only play once.

     There are some special keys, described in the next section that can
     be used to whiz through a module like a CD player.



     3.1 MODPLAY PRO IN THE BACKGROUND
     ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

     It is now possible to make MODPLAY play your mod whilst executing
     any other program!  So you could use it in demos etc.

     Given a program you wish to run, say c:\bin\demo.exe, with a module
     in the current directory of, say sausage.mod then

     mp (other options) /q=c:\bin\demo.exe sausage.mod

     Will start your program running.

     One possible error message 'Could not shell to DOS' may appear. In
     the future this will be more helpful and say if it is either
     a) Out of Memory or
     b) Could not find c:\bin\demo.exe ..etc..

     Playing a MOD takes up quite a bit of CPU time, so to compensate
     the MOD mixing speed is dropped by about 6kHz.  This means that
     speaker output will sound a bit 'off'.  If you need more CPU time
     for you task then use the /a option before the /q.


     4. MODPLAY PRO IN INTERACTIVE MODE
     ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

     MP on its own or MP [options] -i will bring up a display menu screen
     help on all key presses is available by pressing F1.   From this screen 
     you can change directory, change drive or play one or more modules.

     The commands allowed are:

     Basic Keys:


     Cursor Keys Move the highlight bar together with the 'PgUp',
                 'PgDn', 'Home' and 'End' keys.

     <SPACE>or   This will play the current module highlighted, or change
     <RETURN>    to the directory or drive hightlighted

     <ESC>       Quits modplay Pro

     <c>         Brings up a menu showing all the possible output devices.
                 Lets you move around them using the arrow keys and select
                 one by pressing SPACE or RETURN.

     <v>         Displays information about MODPLAY PRO

     <!>         Lets you perform DOS commands.

     <d>         Deletes the highlighted module after confirmation
  
     Advanced:


     <t>         Tags the currently highlighted module (displays a "+")
                 or untags the module if already tagged.

     <T>         Tags all modules in directory

     <U>         Untags all modules in directory

     <p>         Plays all tagged modules in sequence.

     <s>         Takes you into the Sample sub-menu screen

     <v>         Displays program compiled date and version information
     

     Sample Sub-menu:


     From here you can look at the samples that make up the module - there
     are a few special keys that perform various functions that are not
     fully tested and are provided for users that know what they are
     doing (i.e. not bomb proof input routines!)

     <p>         Plays the sample highlighted

     <m>         Plays the whole module

     <w>         Prompts for a filename and then saves the sample to disk

     <r>         Reads a new sample into the old slot.

     also, you can play any sample at any pitch you like.  Pressing
     F1, F2, F3 change which octave you are playing in (low, mid, high) and
     then the number keys play the sample.  1=C, 2=D, 3=E, 4=F, 5=A, 6=B.
 

     5. PLAYBACK KEYS
     ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────── 

     During any playback, pressing the left arrow key will slow the music
     down, the right arrow key will speed it up and the down arrow key
     restores to default speed.  The PageDown key will skip to the next
     track, PageUp jumps back one track.  The END key will (almost)
     pause the music, with the down arrow key restoring the speed.
     The F1 key toggles help which lists all the keys currently available.

     The F8 key turns on the Spectum Analyser display (with bars)
         F9 key turns on test mode
         F10 key turns on the Spectrum Analyser display (no bars)
         F7 key goes back to the old flashing blobs.

         +     Decreases the total volume of this and future mods
         -     Increases the volume of this and future mods
         1     Toggles channel 1 on/off (Similarly 2,3,4)
	 s     Shells to DOS whilst still playing
     
     6. SPECTRUM ANALYSER
     ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

     Hey!  Seen those so-called spectrum analysers on other trackers?
     They are not real!   If you look closer at 'Tr**ster' then you
     will see that this is really just showing the pitch of the notes
     being played... others cheat in a similar way.   MODPLAY PRO has a
     real 32 point Fourier Transform.   Okay, so there are a few bugs,
     but there is no other PC tracker with a ***REAL*** Spectrum!  If you
     want to test this out - try playing a speech sample on a single
     channel.  All other trackers just display a peak at one frequency 
     (the pitch you are playing it at).  MODPLAY PRO actually displays the
     frequency components of the sample.

     a)  If your machine is a bit slow then it can't keep up and it
         will leave the odd red bar on the screen.  Just press F8 to
         get rid of them

     b)  Yeah, its a linear frequency axis - okay it should be logrithmic
         but there is no simple formulea to get this to work - so you'd
         need a dedicated DSP chip.

     c)  It'll be in graphic mode very soon.

          ║                         
          ║                       If you see any other trackers with a 
          ║                       similar display - they probably 
          ║ █                     copied the code (let me have a copy
          ║ █   █        █        and I will see if they did!)

     7. LISTS OF MODULES
     ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

     If like me you have hundreds of modules spread over many disks you
     may find the -o option useful.  This option writes out a list of
     mods in the current directory to the screen which can be redirected
     to a file.   Example:

     A:\> mp -o > c:\mod\list\disk21.lst

     Would create a file c:\mod\list\disk21.lst with the contents similar to:

     AXELF.MOD           axel f                   15    83   110k     10:24
     FCMEDINA.MOD        funky cold medina        31    31   229k     01:56
     HUMANINV.MOD        human invasion           31    26   197k     03:15
     KYLIEMIX.MOD        kyliemix                 15    15    59k     01:52
     SJUNGLE.MOD         street jungle            31    45   135k     05:38
     THEMODEL.MOD        the model                31    28    74k     03:30

     Number of Samples in the MOD (15/31)  ───────┘     │     │       │
     Number of patterns in the MOD (1..127) ────────────┘     │       │
     File Size ───────────────────────────────────────────────┘       │
     Estimated playing time (correct about 70% of the time) ──────────┘


     8. VERSION
     ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 
     The -v flag displays automatic information about your version of MODPLAY.
     It will show the main version number and the exact date/time it was
     compiled, for example:

     C:\> mp -v

     Program        : SUPER MODPLAY PRO GOLD + (MP-LITE.COM) 
     Version        : 314.15  (October 1997)
     Compiled on    : 09-02-1997 at 20:30:58
     Compiled by    : Mark Cox

     It now also gives an estimate of your machine speed (for use in
     later versions to alter the mixing speed)  and also dates and versions
     of all my source code modules.


     9. ARCHIVED MODULES
     ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

     Using a popular archiving utility normally saves about 30% of disk space
     for modules.  Support is now added so that MODPLAY PRO will automatically 
     find and play modules stored in archives (in interactive mode only at
     present).    Modules can be archived into LZH ZIP ARJ or ZOO format and
     there can be more than one MOD file per archive. (Modules in archive must
     have .MOD or .NST extension)
     MODPLAY PRO runs your unpacker for you, creating the .MOD file 
     temporarily on your hard disk; plays the .MOD file then deletes it.  
     MODPLAY PRO needs unpackers with the following names (or batch files
     with these names) somewhere on your path.

     ZIP:          pkunzip                   ARJ:           arj
     LZH:          lha                       ZOO:           zoo


     10. SOURCE OF MODULES
     ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

     You can obtain modules from many Bulletin Boards,  Internet sites or from
     friends Amiga's.  Modules usually come archived in LZH form, these can be 
     unpacked with the excellent LHA program.  The files will usually unpack 
     as 'mod.something' and so MSDOS cuts them short to 'mod.SOM' and it is 
     best to rename these to 'something.mod' so that MODPLAY PRO will 
     automatically detect them.

     The site:  ab20.larc.nasa.gov   contains lots of really good mods in the
     /incoming/amiga/NoiseTracker/U4IA  directory.

     14. FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS LIST
     ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
     
     These are a selection of comments/suggestions and questions I have
     received.

     Q. I keep getting 'Divide Error' and my computer locks up
     A. Some modules I have seen are corrupt - there is no way MODPLAY can 
        tell and there is no time to do any checks - use the 's' command and
        you should be able to see if the module has any garbage in it.

     Q. It sounds like my computer is about to explode.
     A. You have a small piezo speaker - why not build a resistor D/A as
        explained above or put a nice sized speaker (Radio Shack/Tandy) in
        instead.

     Q. Can I edit modules?
     A. Not with MODPLAY PRO - use MODEDIT v2 written by Norman Lin that uses
        MODRES a resident version of MODPLAY

     Q. Ever thought of supporting 8 channels like 'Startreker'?
     A. Yeah, but you would need a 20Mhz+ to run it...and I haven't found
        enough modules that support it yet though.

     Q. Can I have the source? Please?  Pretty please?
     A. No!

     Q. I can't find this ZN426E chip
     A. Try MAPLIN otherwise you could always substitute any D/A or use the 
        resistor version

     Q. I sent mail to you three years ago!
     A. It takes a while for my mail to be forwarded on to me, and I don't
        have an enormous amount of time to answer Email etc.  I'll try to
        reply to everything I receive (if you can wait a bit!)

     Q. "Speech on the IBM PC is not just a case of 'yet another Lotus-1-2-3'
         but a basic piece of innovative software which is being incorporated
         into several commercial products at this very moment.  Releasing an
         un-supported non-commercial product of this nature is a highly 
         irresponsible act which we cannot stand by and watch without doing our
         utmost to prevent" - A UK company talking about the PLAY program.
     A. (I'll let you make your own answer up, send me your favourite)
